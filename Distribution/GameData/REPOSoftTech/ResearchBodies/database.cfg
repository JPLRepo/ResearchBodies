		Moho = So hot. This is one of the first things we thought after discovering Moho. If one day we want to explore it, we'll have to care about temperature.
		Eve = Our instruments are so powerful that we were able to see a purple dot in the sky. Bob named it Eve.First, we thought it was an ice cream like Minmus, but then scientists at R&D said it's impossible that close to the Sun.
		Gilly = The ultimate question for the time being is : How did we do to find Gilly ?
		Minmus = Jeb will be happy. A new ice cream world named Minmus has just been found orbiting around Kerbin ! So close ! You won't need snacks anymore if you're going there.
		Duna = For a long time, maybe for thousands of years, we saw a red dot in the sky. A star ? Snacks ???! We weren't able to tell. Unfortunately, we are sure it's not snacks. It's Duna.
		Ike = What is this big thing here ? I prefer the awesome Duna's red ! Ike is apparently orbiting Duna.
		Dres = We've just discovered Dres, a small grey planet orbiting around the Sun.
		Jool = Well... Guys, we discovered Jool, a big kerb... planet, gas planet.
		Laythe = First we thought we saw Kerbin in a mirror, but we didn't. This is Laythe.
		Vall = Vall's incredibly looking like Minmus, said Bobak Kerman at KSC.
		Tylo = We didn't discovered a 'normal' body for a long time now, said scientists at R&D after discovering Tylo.
		Bop = Bop seems to be a captured asteroid, so it became a Jool's satellite.
		Pol = I didn't know flowers can orbit planets ! Well, Pol doesn't really come from a flower, but it could in fact as pollen.
		Eeloo = So far, so cold, so white, so tiny, so whatever-you-want ! This is Eeloo.
