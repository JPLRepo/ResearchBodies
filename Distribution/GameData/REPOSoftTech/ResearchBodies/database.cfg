		Moho = So hot. This is one of the first things we thought after discovering Moho. If one day we want to explore it, we'll have to worry about temperature.
		Eve = Our instruments are so powerful that we were able to see a purple dot in the sky. Bob named it Eve. First, we thought it was ice cream like Minmus, but then scientists at R&D told us that's impossible so close to the Sun.
		Gilly = The ultimate question for the time being is: How did we find Gilly?
		Minmus = Jeb will be happy. A new ice cream world named Minmus has just been found orbiting around Kerbin! So close! You won't need snacks anymore if you're going there.
		Duna = For a long time, maybe for thousands of years, we saw a red dot in the sky. A star? Snacks?! We weren't able to tell. Unfortunately, we are sure it's not snacks. It's Duna.
		Ike = What is this big thing here? A moon for Duna? But how can something so red have a moon?
		Dres = We've just discovered Dres, a small grey planet orbiting the Sun.
		Jool = Well... guys, we discovered Jool, a big kerb... planet, gas planet.
		Laythe = First we thought we saw Kerbin in a mirror, but we didn't. This is Laythe.
		Vall = Vall's looks incredibly like Minmus, according to Bobak Kerman at KSC.
		Tylo = We haven't discovered a 'normal' body for a long time now, said scientists at R&D after discovering Tylo.
		Bop = Bop seems to be an asteroid captured by Jool's huge gravity field.
		Pol = I didn't know flowers could orbit planets! Well, Pol doesn't really come from a flower, but it looks a lot like pollen.
		Eeloo = So far, so cold, so white, so tiny, so whatever-you-want ! This is Eeloo.
